# Python Programming: An Introduction

This README provides a brief overview of various fundamental concepts in Python programming.

## Why Python programming is awesome

Python is an awesome programming language due to its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It's widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

## What is an object

In Python, everything is an object. An object is a self-contained unit that combines both data and the functions that operate on that data.

## What is the difference between a class and an object or instance

A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object (or instance) is a concrete instantiation of a class. Classes define the structure, and objects represent specific instances of that structure.

## What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object

Immutable objects cannot be modified after creation (e.g., strings, tuples). Mutable objects can be modified (e.g., lists, dictionaries).

## What is a reference

A reference is a value that points to an object in memory. Variables in Python are references to objects.

## What is an assignment

Assignment is the process of associating a name (variable) with an object. It binds a reference to an object.

## What is an alias

An alias is when two or more variables refer to the same object. Changes to one variable may affect the others.

## How to know if two variables are identical

You can use the `is` operator to check if two variables refer to the same object in memory.

## How to know if two variables are linked to the same object

Comparing variables with `is` can tell you if they are linked to the same object.

## How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)

You can use the `id()` function to obtain the memory address (identifier) of an object.

## What is mutable and immutable

Mutable objects can be modified after creation, while immutable objects cannot.

## What are the built-in mutable types

Examples of built-in mutable types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.

## What are the built-in immutable types

Examples of built-in immutable types in Python include strings, tuples, and frozensets.

## How does Python pass variables to functions

Python passes variables to functions by reference. This means that changes made to mutable objects within a function can affect the original object.
