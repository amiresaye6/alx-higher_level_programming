## What is a URL?
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is an address used to identify resources on the internet, specifying the protocol, domain, and resource location.

## What is HTTP?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transmitting data over the internet, facilitating communication between web servers and clients.

## How to Read a URL
Understanding the structure of a URL involves deciphering its components like the protocol, domain, path, and query parameters.

## HTTP URL Scheme
HTTP URLs typically start with a scheme (e.g., http:// or https://) indicating the protocol for communication.

## Domain Names and Sub-Domains
A domain name represents the unique identification of an entity on the internet, while a sub-domain is a division or subsection of a domain.

## Defining Port Numbers in URLs
Port numbers are optional in URLs and allow specific services on a server to be accessed.

## Understanding Query Strings
Query strings are used to send additional information to a server, often seen after the '?' in a URL.

## HTTP Requests and Responses
HTTP involves clients sending requests to servers and receiving responses containing the requested data.

## HTTP Headers
HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response, aiding in data interpretation and handling.

## HTTP Message Body
The HTTP message body carries the actual data being sent in an HTTP request or response.

## HTTP Request Methods
Request methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., define the action to be performed on the specified resource.

## HTTP Response Status Codes
Response status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) indicate the outcome of an HTTP request.

## HTTP Cookies
HTTP cookies are small pieces of data stored in a client's browser to maintain stateful information between HTTP requests.

## Making Requests with cURL
cURL is a command-line tool used to make HTTP requests and retrieve data from servers.

## Application-Level Browser Behavior
Typing 'google.com' in a browser triggers a series of steps involving DNS resolution, HTTP requests, and rendering to display the Google homepage.

This repository provides explanations, examples, and resources to deepen your understanding of HTTP concepts and practical usage.

Happy learning!
