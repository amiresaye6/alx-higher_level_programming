"""
Write a Python script that takes your GitHub credentials
(username and password) and uses the GitHub API to display your id

    You must use Basic Authentication with a personal access token as
    password to access to your information
    (only read:user permission is needed)

    The first argument will be your username
    The second argument will be your password
    (in your case, a personal access token as password)

    You must use the package requests and sys

    You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys

    You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
